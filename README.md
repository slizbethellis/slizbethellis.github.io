This is the current version of my portfolio site. Since top-level GitHub pages won't work from any branch other than master, this repo merely holds the deployed version of my React-based portfolio and not the code I worked on. If you want to see my code, look at my [React Portfolio](https://github.com/slizbethellis/react-portfolio) repository.
