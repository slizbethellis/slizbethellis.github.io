# slizbethellis.gitpages.io

My portfolio site, built with Bootstrap and the [Stylish Portfolio theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/). Background photo is my own photography.

There is a version of this page built in React.js, called [React Portfolio](https://slizbethellis.github.io/react-portfolio), and do take a look at [the repo](https://github.com/slizbethellis/react-portfolio) too.

I tried hosting a copy of the React version of this portfolio as my user page, but because user pages won't deploy from anything other than the master branch, there were a lot of quirks with the deployment. It did work from the master branch, but all of my other GitHub pages looked exactly like the portfolio hosted on the root. So that's why this page is now back to the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/jQuery easings version, instead of the React version. But I did bring over the pair of buttons on the portfolio links (instead of the portfolio items being a single button), which previously have only existed in the React version.
